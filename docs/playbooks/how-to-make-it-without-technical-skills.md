Inspired by [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1336007461719851009?s=20), this playbook offers a 5 step guide on how to make an impact in web3 without ever writing a line of code.

Thereâ€™s an increasing amount of opportunitiy for non-technical users, and this guide aims to give new players the building blocks they need to become a force to be reckoned with.

### 1) Find Your Niche
Whether itâ€™s DeFi, NFTs or social tokens, find a sector of web3 that inspires you and immerse yourself in that world.

Follow all the relevant projects and make yourself an expert in a specific field of emerging knowledge.

There are an infinite number of resources at your disposal. Here are some good places to get started:

* [ETHhub - Resources](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/resources/)
* [The Defiant - DeFi 1010](https://thedefiant.io/defi-101/)
* [Bankless - Getting Started](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-1-starting-with-bankless)
* [DeFi Rate - Top DeFi Projects](https://defirate.com/projects/)
* [Zima Red - NFTs](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/)
* [Crypto Art - Top NFT Artists](https://cryptoart.io/artists)
* [DAOhaus - Explore](https://daohaus.club/explore)

### 2) Learn to Write
Practice writing as much as possible. Donâ€™t try and write for an audience, use writing as a tool to take what you learn and explain it in the simplest way possible.

Hone your craft and spread the word about new trends.

Writing is something that takes years to get great at, so find places to practice and force yourself to keep it as short and sweet as possible.

### 3) Join a Community
Find a group that shares your vision and make yourself known. Discord communities are becoming more robust by the day, and thereâ€™s always opportunities to meet new people with the same interests.

Pop in, introduce yourself and start to get acquainted with where the magic happens. Youâ€™ll quickly notice the 90-9-1 rule, where 1% of people are active contributors, 9% are intermediate contributors and 90% are lurkers.

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to make it into that 1%.

Hereâ€™s a [great thread](https://twitter.com/pet3rpan_/status/1335595502725857280?s=20) from pet3rpan on how to get involved with a DAO today!

### 4) Participate in governance
Every project has a governance forum. Providing feedback and insights on proposals is 100x more valuable than voting â€˜Yesâ€™. This means actively circling back to forums to stay up on the latest posts, and disseminating those discussions in Discord so that others are urged to participate too.

The more you can encourage others to partcipate in governance, the beetter the conversation becomes, and the more likely those same people are to come back time and time again.

Instigate discussions around governance and your circle of friends will grow before your eyes!

A list of projects incentivizing governance today include but are not limited to:

* [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/)
* [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/)
* [Index Co-Op](https://www.indexcoop.com/)
* [yearn](https://yearn.finance/)
* [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/)
* [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/)

### 5) Become a Power User
Get into a rhythm of familiarizing yourself with the new projects in your niche. This means testing them out, playing around with the intended behavior and getting an overall feeling for how the product works and how the different tokens play into it.

These actions will often be used to reward past contributors, meaning that research can turn into pure profit.

Youâ€™ve likely heard of Uniswapâ€™s retroactive airdrop, but did you know there are plenty of other that have happened since?

Better yet, there are plenty more to come! So, get testing.

If youâ€™re looking for what to try next, circle on back to #1 and find your niche!

### Key Takeaways
Focus on everything but trading. Add value through participation, not speculation.
Expect to invest at least a year honing your craft. From there, the flood gates of opportunity will open.
No one can stop your capacity to learn. There is no minimum capital required.
Your success is entirely dependent on your long-term commitment and determination. Do not expect results from these tasks and recognize that the journey is the reward.
