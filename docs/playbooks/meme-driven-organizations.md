> My story started back than when I was seven years old. I and my family were living in Latvia at the time. We were a low-income family living in a neighborhood where you had very limited options and resources but had one promised future either you die from overdosage or alcoholism. This is how most people would end their life in that neighborhood. 
As a child, I already understood that this wasnâ€™t right and that there must be something we could do to make life better for everyone else.
I promised that when I grow up, I will become a president and change peopleâ€™s lives.
So, as you assumed, I didnâ€™t become a president and nether ever be one (Thank god!), but I know that DAOs can be the game changer and be the ones that will allow us to impact peopleâ€™s lives for the best.
