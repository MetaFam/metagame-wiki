# Path of the Writer Episode 1.0

This article will describe a few of many paths a writer might take to earn income, while providing value to others in a decentralized manner in the web3 space. Let's jump right in.

## Decide on the content you would like to cover. Choose something you are passionate about, skilled in, experienced with, and/or want to learn more about. Some things to consider:

- Content should add real world value. Whether you are learning yourself or are a master in your field, you should try to compile information that can truly help those who are reading your content. The idea here is quality over quantity.
- Keep it as short and concise as possible. We can write books upon books on any given subject. The real trick is to condense it down to a golden nugget that you serve your audience.
- KISS: Keep It Simple, Silly. Write in such a way that almost anyone can understand the concepts you are presenting.
- Is this a one-off piece or can you build upon this subject? When gathering your thoughts on a specific subject, jot down different fields or how you might split this subject up. A series on a subject might be easier to write per article while also making each piece more digestible for your audience. This also generates more frequent (not too frequent now. You can overwhelm a subscriber too and we don't want that), reliable material streams for your audience. As per my own suggestion, this article will expand over time into sub-articles.

## Where Do We publish in a web3 world?

## Writers  Spoken and Unspoken Rules

1. No plagiarism. This should be self-explanatory but we will go over some basics. You can cite and quote anyone or anything you want, but you must cite your sources. Quotes should be in "*quotes*", of course, but should also have something like "*~ Author Name Here*" plus a reference number is you are also citing a resource used. No copy paste without proper documentation. This is illegal in many countries throughout the world and can get you blacklisted from some platforms and/or sued by individuals or businesses who monetize the content used.
2. I mentioned citing sources. A reference number should be given to any source of information you used in the process of your research and your writing like this "*(ref.17)*". This reference number should correspond to the references section at the bottom of your article/paper. For an example see this article: (ref.1)

Click on the links and explore these sites, how they work, and what articles are currently present on these particular platforms.

Take note of the type of content themes you see that you could write about and some gaps in content that you might be able to fill.

## Conclusion

In the following Episodes we are going to go through each of these 5 platforms and give an overall description of each, show you  how to sign up for them, and how to use their basic features. Notion is probably the one you want to go ahead and sign up for (though the [next episode](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Notion-Path-of-the-Writer-Ep-2-0-c52ec7cba6ee4519b2879443cde0ba39) we will go through this process), as this series will start here and travel through the other platforms. Some of these are editable, some are not as they will be immutable and on the blockchain. Don't worry, this doesn't mean you can't make stuff "disappear" in a sense and have other things "appear" in their place, or not appear at all. But we'll get into all that later. We’ll see you next episode for some Notion fun.
