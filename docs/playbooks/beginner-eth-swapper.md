# Eth Swapping Onboarding Playbook Notes
###### Creating a slow transaction to teach the user about the possible hiccups during a transaction process.

## High Level

We create a slow transaction first in order to show the user how to fix a possibly scary situation FIRST.

A student usually retains what they learned FIRST about a subject, whether it is good or bad information.

This approach aims to show the user there is nothing to worry about during a slow/stuck transaction.

There's no bank to call you have to fix it yourself.

## Unknowns
1. How to present the information below
2. How to include the coin verification and sandwich bot sections

## Plan

1. Continue draft and finalize for review
2. We will likely create modular peices that can be used in multiple areas. The "how to not get screwed" section here, can also be utilized in other areas.

## Steps

### 1. Installing Metamask and Setup RPC's
I like doing this all in one step, the user is more likely to continue using the networks if they are configured first. Generally users are scared of configuration steps, easy as they might be.

There are a plethora of videos and docs available but most cases simple instructions to visit metamask.io suffice. Make sure they hit the correct url or Lord help us all.

### 2. Advanced gas controls

### 3. First Transaction (simple and clean)
Ex: Order a pizza, send money to friend.

### 4. Second Transaction (create a slow tx)
Use low gas on purpose, make it get stuck.

### 5. Show the user the details on the etherscan page
tx time, gas fee, nonce, etc

### 6. Go to metamask and guide the user through speeding up the tx, advanced, setting gas manually




### 7. Explain NONCE and why we need to execute on the same nonce when we are speeding up. Probably have resources here we don't have to recreate.

### 8. Guide the user through setting the nonce and gas, and continue with speeding up

### 9. Once the tx is successful, THEN show the user how a normal transaction occurs.

### 10. Probably Best to execute step 9 on xdai or similar for low gas fees. I have found xdai is a much smoother and digestable experience for newbies. Sometimes i skip mainnet altogether.

### 11. VERIFY ITS THE CORRECT COIN DUMMY: You can act this out.

### 12. Get wrecked by a sandwich bot
