# ü§î And who is building MetaGame?

A bunch of nobodies from around the internet. Some anons & some simply unknowns. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

-   None of us went to Harvard or Yale.
-   None of us have "prev. @FAANG" in our bios.
-   What we do have is an understanding of the potential of crypto.
     -  And a burning desire to use it & build a better future.

Though we're the ones building this specific metagame called MetaGame; we're far from the only ones playing the metagame.

- A metagamer is anyone who says "fuck off" to the old game of working for corporations & fighting their battle for ever more profit and instead focuses on creating the new game of life with purpose driven organizations.
- Anyone who chose to escape the drudgery of a 9-5 job & enter the future of work by joining a DAO or starting their own.
- Is it *you*?

Anyway, here's the current list of all [players](https://my.metagame.wtf/players) & [patrons](https://my.metagame.wtf/patrons).

## üëë Become a Founder of MetaGame

>MetaGame is an idea we can build a new world on top of the old one.
It is currently being built by a bunch of Ethereum & Open Source fanatics who believe this ‚Äúblockchain thing‚Äù gave us an opportunity to challenge the status quo and reimagine the way we run societies.

We wish to build a society that:

-   Is more open, transparent, and decentralized.
-   Has the lines between the institutions and the people blurred.
-   Rewards people & businesses that take care of the community and the environment.

You can join us & become one of the founders of MetaGame.

Here‚Äôs why One might want to become a Founder:

- Because it‚Äôs aligned with their own vision of a better future.
- Because it seems like a great opportunity to work on something meaningful.
- Because it‚Äôs hard to sit idly by and miss a chance to make a difference.


## **We will not be forgotten**
Being the first to build or fund the future, _does_ come with perks:

-   You get to earn XP & Seeds - your skin in the game.
-   You get eternal bragging rights for being one of MetaGame founders.
- A bunch of other lesser things like an achievement, an ever-renewing shirt and whatnot.

Your profile & achievements will serve as a sort of a portfolio/CV inside, and outside the MetaGame.

However, not all founders are made equal - because they don't contribute equally.
The achievements come in ranks, determined by the amount of XP you earned (for players) or the amount of pSeeds you're holding (for patrons):

-   7 **Diamond** Founders
-   7 **Platinum** Founders
-   7 **Golden** Founders
-   14 **Silver** Founders
-   21 **Bronze** Founders

The above numbers were set somewhat arbitrarily, here‚Äôs why:

-   There were 7 figures identified as key for the founding of the USA.
-   The _Declaration of Independence_ was signed by 56 delegates.

## So‚Ä¶
So yeah, if you ever felt like front-running a(n)(r)evolution without leaving your bedroom, this might be the perfect opportunity.
