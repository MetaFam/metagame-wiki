title: üëë Become a Founder of MetaGame
---

>MetaGame is an idea we can build a new world on top of the old one.
It is currently being built by a bunch of Ethereum & Open Source fanatics who believe this ‚Äúblockchain thing‚Äù gave us an opportunity to challenge the status quo and reimagine the way we run societies.

We wish to build a society that:

-   Is more open, transparent, and decentralized.
-   Has the lines between the institutions and the people blurred.
-   Rewards people & businesses that take care of the community and the environment.


And while we‚Äôre likely to fail at changing the world, we _are_ likely to at least build some cool stuff, have and establish a  sort of a [decentralized factory](https://metagame.substack.com/p/narrative-1-a-decentralized-factory).

Here‚Äôs why One might want to become a Founder:

-   Because it‚Äôs aligned with their own vision of a better future.
- Because it seems like a great opportunity to work on something meaningful.
-   Because it‚Äôs hard to sit idly by and miss a chance to make a difference.


## **We will not be forgotten**
Being the first to build or fund the future, _does_ come with perks:

-   You get to earn XP & Seeds - your skin in the game.
-   You get eternal bragging rights for being one of MetaGame founders.
- A bunch of other lesser things like an achievement, an ever-renewing shirt, a spot at the Alignment 2021, and [whatnot](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/why-hodl-seeds/187).

Your profile & achievements will serve as a sort of a portfolio/CV inside, and outside the MetaGame.

However, not all founders are made equal - because they don't contribute equally.
The achievements come in ranks, determined by the amount of _Seeds_ you earned:

-   7 **Diamond** Founders
-   7 **Platinum** Founders
-   7 **Golden** Founders
-   14 **Silver** Founders
-   21 **Bronze** Founders

The above numbers were set somewhat arbitrarily, here‚Äôs why:

-   There were 7 figures identified as key for the founding of the USA.
-   The _Declaration of Independence_ was signed by 56 delegates.

## So‚Ä¶
So yeah, if you ever felt like front-running a(n)(r)evolution without leaving your bedroom, this might be the perfect opportunity.
