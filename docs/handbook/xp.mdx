title: üß¨ XP & Seeds üå±
---

Experience points (XP) can be earned by anyone anytime by engaging on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZqdPP9b), writing on [Discourse](https://metagame.trydiscourse.com/), and laying down code on [GitHub](https://github.com/metafam/), or completing a Quest. You earn XP when you create content and/or when people reference or react to your content. We also have Initiatives to recognize contributions that happened off-line and reward them with XP as well. 

## üìä How do I earn XP?

XP (experience points) are earned by engaging on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZqdPP9b), writing on [Discourse](https://metagame.trydiscourse.com/), laying down code on [GitHub](https://github.com/metafam/), or completing [Quests](https://forum.metagame.wtf/c/quest/5/l/latest?board=default). You get some XP when you create, you get more XP when people reference or react to your creation and then we have _Initiatives_ for awarding XP for things that happen outside those three platforms or aren‚Äôt appreciated enough there.

Due to the way SourceCred works (PageRank) the more XP you have the more weight your engagement has. This creates a soft sybil-resistance where random accounts or profiles can‚Äôt easily embed themselves into the contribution graph without actually contributing.

You can [check your XP here](https://metafam.github.io/TheSource/timeline/@metagame/), but don‚Äôt get attached to the number. Because XP is earned via contributions and engagement, which are always fluctuating; XP scores are always fluctuating. They are not fixed.

## üå± What are Seeds and how do I get them?

As opposed to XP, which is non-transferable and used only for measuring your contribution to MetaGame; Seeds have a value on the market and can be bought & sold. You can think of them as your skin-in-the-game.

If you are earning XP, you will also be earning Seeds. Seeds are awarded based on your XP earned per week through direct actions as well as the XP that flows to you for past contributions as people engage with them over time.

As a result MetaGamers are playing with long-term incentives for collaboration. You receive points for making it easy for others to use and contribute to your contributions.

## üìà WTF is the Seed Market?

The Seed market exists to support value creation. By giving people a way to buy and sell Seeds, we create a community currency. This allows passive MetaGamers to pay for membership, MetaGame‚Äô products & services and gives them the ability to support the valuable work of others in a positive-sum way (‚Äúboosting‚Äù, more later).

MetaGame will create a market on a bonding curve and buy up the initial supply. This will create a price floor. A small fee will be charged to people buying into or out of the Seed market, however all Seed transactions within the Metaverse will have full value. This incentivizes local engagement and spending within the MetaGame universe.

The goal is to have more Seeds coming in through membership dues, and in-game features than there are going out via Seeds earned through XP. In this way MetaGame has a runway of Seeds to support the community until Seed demand eclipses supply. Then the number go up.

## ‚öîÔ∏è What can I use Seeds for?

Right now the uses for Seeds are fairly limited, but you‚Äôll be able to use them for anything you can use other crypto for + the things that will only be payable in Seeds. Here‚Äôs some of those:

-   Paying for membership
-   Paying for any MetaGame Goods/Services
-   Paying for Goods/Services from other players
-   Buying digi-physical items / wearables
-   Staking on Direction / Priorities (Futarchy-ish)
-   Tipping / Boosting other players
-   Creating Guilds
-   Creating Quests
-   Collateralizing your Identity [(personal tokens ‚ÄúWeb of Trust‚Äù)](https://twitter.com/AdamScochran/status/1258053707322863623?s=20)
-   Source of Income

Due to the way SourceCred works (PageRank) the more XP you have the more weight your engagement has. This creates a soft sybil resistance where random accounts or profiles can't easily embed themselves into the contribution graph without actually contributing.

Because XP is earned via contributions and engagement, which are always fluctuating, XP scores are always fluctuating. They are not fixed. Think of them more like an element or the weather. XP is very real, and has very real properties and effects, but it's more of a force of nature than anything.
