# Post Format Template and Guidelines

At this point, the format is pretty loose. But try to stick to this structure:


```
Subject keywords: …

Conversation type: …

Time limit: …

Description:
…
```

### Subject keywords
A few keyword that capture the general theme about what you want to talk about.
This is useful for people scrolling a (potentially long) list of posts and only stopping to read the ones if the subject is interesting to them.

*Example*: humans, sociology, evolutionary biology, societies

*Example*: distributed systems, consensus, protocols

### Conversation type

Pick one from this list:
* **Exchange of recommendations** – I’ll show you my top N (books|shows|tutorials|frameworks|subreddits|…) you show me yours. Great for finding new things to fall in love with and expand your mind through recommendations from people around you.
* **Exchange of point of views** – Talk to someone that (lives far away | grew up in a different environment | is of different age | had different career). Great to open your eyes to the world by looking at it from the perspective of someone else.
* **Debate** – Seek someone with beliefs / values / opinions different than yours for the purpose of (politely) challenging each-other’s point of view. Great to pop your bubble, have your ideas challenged.
* **Collab** – “Study” together, as in: read an article or chapters from a book, then discuss it. Or hack something, or figure something out collaboratively.
* **Activity** - Play an online game, watch a movie, …
* **Tutoring/Help** ( offer or request ) – Offer to share your experience/knowledge on a specific subject, or put out a request for help/input on something you are struggling with or would like to know more about.

### Description
This is a free-form description of the conversation you’d like to have.

Start with a short overview sentence.

*Example*: Let’s exchange our top 10 favorite subreddits. Anything goes. Randomness welcome.

Then go into more details. Remember: clear expectations for both parties is key to having a good time.

Some aspect of the conversation you may want to think/talk about:
* Why you find this topic interesting
* How does it relate to you
* Who is your ideal conversation partner

**Boundaries**, if any — if there’s any aspect/topic you want to avoid.

*Example*: Don’t ask my real name, or the company I work for.

*Example*: Let’s avoid talking US politics / I don’t mind talking US politics.

**Requirements**, if any — any requirement that someone should fulfill if they want to have this conversation.

*Example*: Familiar with Solidity / Good understanding of abstract algebra / Currently living in Europe / Read chapter 1-3 of some book / Worked as software developer for 5+ years / …

### Medium:
Pick one or more of the following:
* Discord chat
* Discord voice
* Discord video
* Discord public voice channel
* Other

### Time limit
If you are meeting someone for the first time, it’s always a good idea to set a time limit in advance. So that there’s no awkwardness about ending the session when time comes.
Even if you are already friend with someone. It’s still a good idea to time-box. You can always decide to stay on longer, or schedule another session soon.

*Example*: 30-60 minutes
