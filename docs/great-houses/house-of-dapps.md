<details>
<summary>Wait, WTF is a dApp?</summary>
<br />
Good question ser / madam!

A dApp is an application whose back end code is running on a decentralised, peer-to-peer network. Decentralized apps are censorship resistant, have no single point of failure and are generally publicly owned and open sourced. This is in contrast to a centralized app like Facebook, Netflix or Twitter that is hosted on centralized servers (they own your data), oft owned by the companies behind the app and as a result are quite susceptible to data breaches, are liable to censorship and skulduggery around selling data. 

With dApps, often the front-end layer is also hosted in a decentralized manner, using a service like [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) to store the code on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

The key factors that define a dApp are [cite: [Definition of a dApp, ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/#definition-of-a-dapp)]:

 ****Decentralized****

 means they are independent, and no one can control them as a group.

****Deterministic****

they perform the same function irrespective of the environment they are executed.

 ****Turing complete****

which means given the required resources, the dApp can perform any action.

****Isolated****,

which means they are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract happens to have a bug, it won‚Äôt hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network.

---

Some dApps can be referred to as 'legos' or 'money legos', with most of the protocols and platforms having APIs or SDKs, recipes for smart contracts or whole DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategies that can be cloned, customized and integrated into other projects.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBuild dApps:

Dev in Web3 & crypto space is not all about writing Smart Contracts and being an expert in cryptography! While you would be in great demand as a Smart Contract developer, the industry is also short of solid Web2 developers with skills in modern front-end stacks.  If you know Python,  you can write Smart Contracts in Python with [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). If you're struggling to find work in Web2 or you're just up for hacking on some bleeding edge stuff, I urge you to jump down the Web3 rabbit hole and come help a DAO to make the world a better place. ‚öîÔ∏è  [MetaGame would love to have you](https://discord.gg/rMa8Ahtv5u) if you have React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Hasura and other front-end skills.
