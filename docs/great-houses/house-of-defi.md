## Wait, WTF is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance is the application of cryptographic tools for financial applications. By trusting in the code we can compose new way to interact with tokens, that means money LEGOS. In the House of DeFi we give you a small taste of different platforms and recap some of the key platforms and their purpose.

Danger can be anywhere. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and equip yourself with the knowledge of how to use some of these blocks; what they can do, and their powers and dangers.

DeFi covers a wide range of tools from traditional borrowing and lending, to flash loans and automatic market makers. WTF is yield farming and, how can you avoid getting rekt?

A fairly comprehensive guide from The Defiant can be found here: [‚úäThe Defiant's Definitive Guide to DeFi](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/the-defiants-definitive-guide-to), but we keep our own index below as well.

## üìà Decentralized Trading

-   [Uniswap Exchange](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) Trade between Ethereum based assets.

-   [1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/) Finds the most optimal route to trade between tokens.

-   [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/) üî∞ Seamless, user-friendly trading.

-   [Curve](https://www.curve.fi/) Swap between stablecoins with very low slippage.
-   [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) An PolyDEX(?!) & DeFi platform supporting 10 networks and uses ArcherDAO MEV Shield to prevent being frontrun Supported networks include: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, xDai, Avalanche, to name a few. üò±
-   [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/) A decent DEX on Polygon but I have found 1Inch and quite possibly Sushi to be a fair bit cheaper on fees.


## üîí Wallets

-   [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) üî∞  Phone wallet with built in dapps, trading, advanced security, and recovery features.

-   [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) A browser based wallet that lets you interact with decentralized apps from your favorite browser. Supports Ledger and Trezor. Mobile wallet also available, although not recommended. Argent wallet is a much safer option for mobile devices.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è *It is recommended to use a Ledger or Trezor with MetaMask in the browser. If you don't have one, buy one (direct from the manufacturer), use it via MetaMask and just use MetaMask itself as a burner wallet. You won't regret it.*
