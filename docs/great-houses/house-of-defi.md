<summary>Wait, WTF is DeFi? 🤔</summary>
<br />

Decentralized Finance is the application of cryptographic tools for financial applications. By trusting in code we can compose new ways to interact with tokens, which means money LEGOS. In the House of DeFi, we give you a small taste of some different DeFi platforms as well as recap some of the key platforms while covering their purpose.

* But why do we need DeFi? Don't we get financial services from banks?

TL;DR:  Want to ape a $5k investment into something at 3 AM (don't FOMO 😬), donate $10k to a small charity project in Costa Rica via [Giveth](https://giveth.io), borrow $1k to fix your car, send $100 to a friend on the other side of the world, or simply earn some interest on the assets you have in your wallet? With DeFi you can, and you don't have to go to a local bank branch, call anyone, or answer any probing questions before you do it. You can just do it. You become your own bank and it feels damn good.

It's true, we do get financial services from banks like Wells Fargo, HSBC, Lloyds, etc. But the banks aren't very nice and only serve to benefit their shareholders. Banks offer high interest accounts earning a whopping 0.1% APY and charge us to use their fine services. 🥳 For this amazing yield, we deposit funds into banks, and *our* funds are used to provide the liquidity for them to offer their services, make exorbitant profits from those services, and invest in arms and other nefarious ventures.  Not content with taking all the profit for themselves and making the world a poorer place, they also charge you to have these accounts and hammer you hard if you fall out of favor. Yay the banks. 💔

Decentralized Finance or "DeFi" is a bit different. 🙌 You get most of the same services you get in traditional, centralized finance, or "TradFi", but instead of the banks holding all the money and profiting from everything, the functions they traditionally perform are rolled into code (Smart Contracts) by very clever developers - often open-sourced - and run in a permissionless state on a global, public network of nodes (blockchain), using decentralized storage and no intermediaries involved. Anyone can deposit their assets, play an active role in the protocol, and get a share in the profits. 😁

Users are incentivized to use a protocol and often earn yield in the protocol's own token, which then can give them the ability to partake in the governance and evolution of the protocol, while being invested in the growth of DeFi itself.

Using, depositing, lending, borrowing & staking all can produce different yields that often vary, with the typical being 1-10% and in some (usually risky) cases, even 100%+. Often it will be much much more for the early users of these platforms. This is not without risk and you must always research anything you're considering throwing your precious assets at, *but* educate yourself, use risk management, and it is possible to begin to free yourself of the very broken financial system and make some sweet gains and passive income along the way.

DeFi covers a wide range of tools from traditional borrowing and lending, to flash loans, automatic market makers (AMM), staking, and yield farms. WTF is yield farming and, how can you avoid getting rekt? Get educated...

A fairly comprehensive guide from The Defiant can be found here: [The Defiant's Definitive Guide to DeFi](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/the-defiants-definitive-guide-to), but we keep our own index below as well.

> ⚠️Danger can be anywhere. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and equip yourself with the knowledge of how to use some of these tools; what they can do, and their powers and dangers.⚠️

## 👨‍🌾 Yield Farming

One of the 'magic' money sides to DeFi is Yield Farming. Earn interest and passive income through depositing your assets into a wide variety of protocols to provide liquidity for exchanges and lending platforms. You can also borrow against your assets and earn yield in platform tokens & stablecoins. 

Borrowing against your assets is a form of CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) and you can [read more about it here](https://defitutorials.substack.com/p/collateralized-debt-positions-cdps) 👀
