# House  of DeFi 

## Wait, WTF is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance is the application of cryptographic tools for financial applications. By trusting in the code we can compose new way to interact with tokens, that means money LEGOS. In the House of DeFi we give you a small taste of different platforms and recap some of the key platforms and their purpose. 

Danger can be anywhere. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) and equip yourself with the knowledge of how to use some of these blocks; what they can do, and their powers and dangers.
