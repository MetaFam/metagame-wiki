<center><b>WTF is Permaculture? How is it Intrinsic and particularly Extrinsic to Metagame and why is it a key to a realistic and balanced future for Mankind</center></b>

The first thing that we need to establish is that we are speaking from the point of view of Westernised, Democratised and a generally Capitalistic point of view; also the language we use is fundamentally and structurally different from every other culture other than the above, so we are not only explaining definitions here, but more importantly explaining them from this point of view. This is incredibly important to remember and to hold with you, as you transition any knowledge uptake you indulge in and particularly when you then try to explain it to others. We are in the business of Re-Coding thousands of years of Patriarchy, misappropriated spirituality, centralisation of power and the general pillage of the globe to feed the bottom-up capitalist corporate harvester.

This clearly doesn’t apply to contemporary roots cultures, e.g.  foraging/nomadic tribal communities, or in fact anyone that has truly achieved low impact sustainability in their lives.

The reason I start with this, is because the work is specific and to know what the task is, defines the tone of this guide. There is so much information on the internet pertaining to Permaculture. It’s overwhelmingly prolific, which is amazing, but it’s really important to remind ourselves that since the beginning of time there has been what we term in English "Permaculture"; it is in essence Biodiversity/Biomimicry – harnessing and marrying our existence, our social dynamics and the cultivation of our crops and society to and with our surrounding ecosystem, on the basis that we are a part of the overall ecosystem. Not above it! And certainly not the masters of it! For the moment we position ourselves apart from our ecosystem, we cease to be a part of it thereby abandoning our post and our post was and is, as important as an earthworm.

Let us also in the early stages identify the enemy, the enemy of all that is good and wonderful in this miraculous and awe-inspiring world in which we have had the incredible privilege to have been birthed into and to fully fulfil our obligation towards graciousness, we must understand what it is that we must overcome.

Monoculture: The destruction of existing diversity to facilitate homogeneity. The reasoning for this is usually improved efficiency of top-down control, the dangers of this are that it is fundamentally unsustainable (Creating massively disproportionate energy inputs to initiate and maintain, an absence of regionalised benefit, huge volumes of unmanageable waste and an incredibly fragile immunity. One disaster, disease can wipe out a whole system rapidly and unimpeded), eating its way through the planet systematically, leaving us in the slightly unnerving situation of a mass extinction event due to there being nothing left at all.

There is this idea that Permaculture, which is definitely a zeitgeist amongst capitalised mankind, begun in the 1970’s, was coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren when in fact it has been (appropriately) around since the beginning of time and will endure until the end. These fine gentlemen have taken a long hard look at how things have been over the preceding millennia and have distilled what they have found into a wonderful manual for not fucking things up any further! So I have structured the below to access all you can need to gain a comprehensive understanding of how in our language we explain these subjects, but please understand that we are not coining or inventing ideas, they/we are collating information passed down for 1000’s if not millions of years, held in oral tradition, genetic memory and more recently the tip of the iceberg in written format available online.

We are in a constantly moving and changing world and as well as our environment being constantly on the move, so is our understanding and ways of interpreting it and ultimately our ways of explaining it, however, if you have something to add, or something to question, then you are most welcome and I hope that it will move this work on, in an ever more poignant and progressive direction. We are in the business of positive strides forward, even positive tippy toe, teeny, weeny steps would be good, but definitely inspired by a sturdy boot up the ass and not a lament of the kimchi we are in!!

Nothing is sacred other than our Earth Mother Gaia and all upon and from her in essence and not in synthesis, we are all sacred, but our mouths and pens can utter absolute Beauty and conversely absolute Bollocks.

<center><b>Permaculture: A Design Principal, of Sustainability Rooted in the reflection of natural ecosystems, the diversity and symbiosis by which the whole is perpetually sustained by the sum and interaction of the parts. <p class="big"><b>The MF Ethics</b></center>

**Earth Care:** Our No.1 Priority is ensuring our species and in fact, all the other species we share this world with, still have a home called Planet Earth in the future. Sure we can find another planet to live on, but what then? do the same over? There are only so many Planets fit for purpose and once we've run out. There Are No More, in striking distance. De-Centralising everything (This includes Food Production, Manufacturing, Technologies, The Internet and more) Rewilding, Re-Greening & Sustainable Energy Production and the restoration and preservation of our Planet's ecosystem means that even if we have to move on to another planet, we have a sustainable model for life to take with us. We have some major challenges to deal with including the re-balancing of carbon in our atmosphere, which is going to make little difference to the commited warming curve we are already on, but does mean that in about 40 years we will start to stabilise, but only once we have ceased our current carbon spewing, with positive reversal protocols including planting millions and millions of trees, along with other initiatives to capture Carbon, which are many and varied. Do not be in any doubt that 8 billion people all doing a little bit will help with this! It will and so get involved in whatsoever way you can! The main focus has to be on Industry though!

**People Care:** Human Beings were not supposed to exist as automatons mindlessly repeating tasks for the benefit of a corporation to profit in the boomerang of produce and services that could have been delivered at source in the first place by the very people enslaved into a cycle of pointless parts existent only to create as many price points as possible, the cost to individuals has been devastating, including physiological damage from interuptions to their gene rhythms, over-concentrations of chemical exposures to communities and individuals, repetitive injuries and psychological damage from lack of natural light, absence from families and the theft of their creativity, freewill and calm. The devolution of power and supply and production is at the heart of the solution to this, decentralising everything (This includes Education, Identity Control, IP Control, Financial Control, Botanical Seed Control, Medicines, Medical Records, Policing and more), Community Regeneration, Wealth Redistribution and ultimately this comes down to people getting their lives back as their own.

**Equitable Share:** By Re-appropriating the governance of our own needs and surplus, we can create equitable trading and remuneration (an example of this would be the emergence of DAO’s, Bartering schemes, online shopping sites for individuals and organisations and Farmer's Markets which allow peer to peer flow of finance/value).  Avoiding/Eliminating superfluous roles, tiers in production, distribution and point of sale/delivery creates a value surplus which feeds the sustainability of the individual financially and/or can be set aside to further the above principles and/or store and use to encourage progress of personal and community efforts in de-linking themselves from overheads, challenging the ability to be financially self sufficient.

**Knowledge Share:** By building and using networks at a local level and through worldwide networks on the web, we are and can, connect people of similar ambition and interests, in the movement away from monoculture and capitalism, tightly align these networks with Earth Hubs/Outposts, which can then spawn guides whom through the exposure and immersion are able to then take and proliferate the message, first hand, with overwatch support, to accelerate the necessary learning, to enable the Decentralisation process and the return of basic needs being met at a local level.

<center><b>The MF Principles</b></center>

**Observe and Interact:**  Take the time to understand cycles, rhythms, relationships, triggers and then when you have begun to understand the subtleties and the delicacies of the ecosystem around you, then find a you-sized space to put yourself, or your requirements in. If you look hard enough, or for long enough, there is always a you-sized space.

**Catch and Store Energy:**  Don’t let energy get away, it’s all around us moving at different speeds and occurring at different frequencies, it may not be there for another 6 months, but maybe there was enough last week to last for 6 months if you’d been able to capture it and then store it, interactions between different sources is incredibly useful in terms of modulation throughout the day and night as a short cycle, or from winter and summer as a longer waveform. A great example of this is graviticity, a new electricity modulation technique which is proposing the use of disused mine shafts and heavy weights, in which they are raising the weights at low electricity usage periods and dropping the weights on dynamos at peak times to modulate electricity supply to modulate the supply demand ratio, you know so people can boil their kettle in the intermission. In the same way my Italian neighbours in Lugliano, would harvest tomatoes in the summer and bottle them for the winter, they would trade these with other producers for Limoncello, meat from the boar hunts, Porcini mushrooms, some of which would have been dried, again to be available for the non productive months.

**Obtain a Yield:** It’s easy to get carried away with the rest, but maximising yield is critical and can provide enough surplus to sustain fallow periods as well as to sustain those around you, who may be able to reciprocate in other ways you hadn’t even imagined if they are able to and if they are not, you are supporting them in their basic needs so they are able to survive without the mantle of consumerism and politically agendised supply chain.

**Apply Relf-Regulation and Accept Feedback:** So…This is back to the Decentralisation of everything! And incidentally how we should all conduct ourselves as people! But be in no doubt that decentralising ourselves, our cultivation, our finances, our learning, our manufacturing, etc. Does not mean that we have to do it alone, in fact it gives us more of an opportunity to connect with others and to share ideas, to receive guidance and advice and to ultimately implement it, once we have tweaked it to our native environment. It is our own responsibility to be mindful of how we tread. No one else’s! Do you remember your parents telling you to pick up after yourself???? Well try to keep that in mind as you tread the boards of life and you grow; as you grow this very simple mantra should grow with you. You should not need parents to remind you of this very simple technique once you are an adult!

**Use and value Renewable Resources and Services:** Back to Rhythms and Cycles, exploit and conserve these when they wax and release them gradually when they wane. From the large examples to the small, there is always something that you can do. Convert your diesel engine to run on old chip fat, it’s really not that complicated and enhances the reduction of carbon you have released by opting for an old second hand diesel motor, instead of buying a new vehicle, exponentially! Stick a mini hydro setup in your stream! Insulate the hell out of your house, wear a jumper and turn the heating off! Get a wind turbine, stick a thermal heat store in your house and run it off Solar, back Boiler on your stove and electric, so that your boiler only kicks in once in a blue moon. Harvest Rainwater, drop into a raised tank for hotwater (Run some alcethyne pipes through a compost heap let convection do the rest and have 55 degree celsius showers forever, drop a tank underground with your cold water and if you’re feeling really adventurous get a couple of bore holes drilled and use one for 60,000 year old limestone filtered tap water and the other for heating. Get some goats/sheep, or a little donkey and put the goddamn mower away! You can get haulage muscle, or milk and meat, you can’t eat or milk a mower (Please don’t try this at home kids, particularly whilst the motor’s running). The options are endless and they come in all shapes and sizes, so explore your options and pick a couple that suit your setup….

**Produce no Waste:** This is one of the most tangible indicators of how well you are doing. In non-anthropogenic nature, there is NO WASTE!! If you are trying to run shit in an efficient way, there IS NO WASTE!! If you get to zero, you’re doing OK, but don’t pat yourself on the back just yet, because you should be in credit at least to the volume of what you initially thought was waste before you are nailing it!! That is the point where you can give yourself a pat on the back and quite frankly when you will have the time to do so.

**Design from Patterns to Detail:** Again – Rhythms and Cycles people!! Take the time to See WTF is going on and then and only then start designing, look, there are so many complex examples to bring to bear here, but let’s keep it simple, a flower that likes the sun does not grow on the north slope of a hill and moss doesn’t grow on the south face of a tree. So, be more-clever than a flower or moss, FFS, how many freaking cells are in your body! Plus, you probably need to have some chocolate trifle around. Hot-tip, one regular tea bag and a tea bag of lady grey in the one cup, yep, I know it’s totally out there, but ohhhh so good! and brings me nicely on to the next principle.

**Integrate rather than Segregate:** If you segregate, then you are stupid and deserve to fail completely and there is no hope for you, natural selection will hopefully do away with you. So reference material here is Flooding & Weeds (Please excuse where I get a bit rural, rustic and earthy, because this shit most definitely applies to Social Design, Web Design, Manufacturing Design et al, it’s just these are my comfort zones, so not segregating less earthbound studies/practices, just using the most familiar examples to me for furthering a point that can when better understood be brought to bear in other environments more effectively, because I used such remote examples :-D), anyway back to flooding, so segregate water management from all of its familiar relationships and you get incredible flooding when it rains/snow melt etc. and everything washed away to the ocean in moments leaving no water and absolute destruction behind it. Now if you put the river in some wildly optimistic concrete canal, from which it must never meander! Bypassing completely all the essential buffering of self regulating ecosystem infrastructure, the floods come and they just keep on rising. If we retrofit everything that was there before we came along and took it all away, we start to see correction, trees drink up to 50 gallons of water a day, beavers can create the most wonderful habitats for a myriad of wonderful creatures, whilst also modulating the flow of a swollen river. Wetlands exist to soak up and release these ebbs and flows of current, naturally, but we like to drain them and build on them and wonder why we can’t get house insurance against an act of God!! It’s not an act of God! It’s an act of Anthropogenic Madness! Growing your garden you will have invariably at some point pulled your hair out at about the same frequency as the futile pulling of weeds, look, there is no such thing as weeds!! There is space and conditions for something to grow, as with a leader like Trump, Yes I brought him up!! He; is not the problem, the problem is the environment that leaves a space for him to grow! - On a social level, if you segregate individuals or groups, you are not only losing whatever human value they may have added to your equation, you are actually value negative, because they are now going to rail against you for that segregation (A traditional african proverb goes something like this: “The child who is sent from the village, will come back and burn the village down” - The Positive version of this is: “It takes a village to raise a child”). We are all from the same place, yep all made of stardust, everything and all of us and mother earth as well, so simply put we need to acknowledge all parts of an ecosystem and to understand we are a part of it, we are not masters of it and to get the best out of ourselves all of our souls and parts are to be understood, valued, seen, smelt, felt, tasted and heard.

**Use Small and Slow Solutions:**  So we all saw what happened when Gorbachev introduced democracy to the USSR quickly, yep all the wealth got snapped up by Oligarchs and the power remained with the elite! Same happened when the Raj withdrew from India, 1.5% of Indian and Pakistani nationals were left at the helm. When Tito died in what was Yugoslavia, virtually overnight, the power vacuum that was left in the Balkans, where for years as the dictator he had been attempting to create an evenly dispersed cultural diversity (via some very dubious forced movements of communities, individuals and families), descended into absolute carnage! In the same way if you try to treat an outbreak of cabbage moths with torrents of pesticide, you will destroy a whole ecosystem of creatures, who will self-regulate the cabbage moth situation if given half a chance themselves. What you got to remember is that to plant your cabbages, you just destroyed hundreds of umbelliferae, which were like the street corner for gangs of insectivores to hang out and leer at those ikkle cabbage moth larvae, just before they swooped in and killed every mother fucking last one of them! So, maybe just gently and slowly plant some umbelliferae and other companion and previously existent plants and the rest will write itself. In a mid-range example, we could look at the gradual and determined efforts of Neal Spackman and his co-founders in the re-greening of the desert story of Al Baydah, referenced and linked below. Take your time. "Move at the Speed of Trust. focus on critical connections over critical mass. Build the resilience by building the relationships" (Quote: Emergent Strategy). Sudden change invariably ends in disaster!

**Use and Value Diversity:**  Diversity is our best friend!! It reduces energy inputs, it is the nature of nature, it is the friend of exponentially increasing outputs and remove just one part of a diverse ecosystem and you’re screwed! Basically work-load goes up, resource pool declines, chances of disaster is exponentially up and damage to the environment, already foretold! Diversity in social terms is our friend: Genetically, we get stronger if we don’t have kids with our next of kin, plus we have more aesthetically pleasing features ;-) and when it comes to infrastructure, diversity is where we sometimes find the most surprising and beneficial solutions. If you have a bank run by 50 something crusty, musty establishment guys trying to run a progressive economic model and you have a startup suddenly out of nowhere, because some bright spark was like “Hey we don’t need actual banks anymore, let’s just stick it on people’s smart phones , and send them a notification once the money lands” I’ll leave the rest to your vivid imaginations (Clearly Smart-Phones are a massive problem ecologically and ethically, but are an intrinsic cog in the permaculture existent in society and digitally based communities, it would be awesome to see the back of these, but I am doubtful we will until we have established an implant and HUD replacement tech).

**Use Edges and Value the Marginal:** So; this is me! I’m the edge and the marginal, I came to The Metagame with absolutely no idea WTF you’re all doing, I mean I can’t overstate this, I literally had no idea, it was just the gentle and constant tugging of Luxumbra telling me I should, telling me I could, telling me if I didn’t; I was a wasteman! Anyway, here I am absolutely smashing it! Ha Ha :-D Anyway, back to a level for a moment, in a garden, the edge is quite frankly where it is at! There is a song all about it linked below! And what a song, one of my favourites. Basically what this means is that at the edge of the plot where you didn’t completely destroy everything to grow, you will find that nature still exists and that seeds will have blown about and because it’s at the edge you just let them get on with it, in a systems sense, this is where your system starts to engage with other systems around it and as such is a much more dynamic zone than at the heart of your system where everything is predictable because it is all within the confines of known parameters. The edge is where you learn, it’s where the action is, this is the caramelisation at the edge of your roasting tray that brings the heady flavour to your gravy.

**Creatively Use and Respond to Change:**  Change does not stop! Nothing is constant in this universe and beyond, other than change, we are in a constant state of dynamic flux, again there is no way of over stating this. Try taking a piece of solid oak you’ve planked and telling it to stay flat and where you put it. Not going to happen, that bad boy is on the move and will rip all your fixings out the wall on the way! You need to understand that and work with that plank, this is why in a timber frame, the wooden pegs set through two beams are through offset holes and are gradually knocked in year on year as the frame reposes. I was listening to a podcast with Moxie Marlinspike (Yep that’s his name), the instigator of Signal (Anonymous Messaging), absolute legend, worth a listen actually, a Joe Rogan Podcast, anyway he was talking about the fact that it is a constant and infinite work to keep the software up to date and sympathetic, compatible and resistant to the ever changing software environment that it exists in, notwithstanding the more social and business sides of things as relationships, contracts, fees negotiations etc. This is a not for profit business pitting itself against and alongside the likes of Apple and Google etc… Perfect example of identifying the concerns that people were starting to have about their communication and identities slowly becoming the intellectual property of corporate giants to do what they will with and finding a Moxie sized space which he slipped into and has been nurturing ever since to great accolade and my God! He deserves it, lets all just take a minute to digest what a fucking massive feat he has achieved in terms of creatively using and responding to change!
