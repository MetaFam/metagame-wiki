<summary>ðŸ¤” Wait, WTF are NFTs?</summary>
<br />


NFT stands for [Non-Fungible Token](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/).  Which simply (assuming you have read [House of Ethereum](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/great-houses/house-of-ethereum) ) means that, unlike Fungible (ERC-20) tokens, each one is unique and not equivalent and interchangable.  These are encoded in the standards [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/) and [ERC-1155](https://blog.enjin.io/erc-1155-token-standard-ethereum/) and some others, like composables: [ERC-998](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/998).


This blockchain innovation started first with [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) before there was a standard in place. CryptoKitties was the first project, launched in 2017, to embed the Non-Fungible standard and take the idea mainstream.

Several characteristics of NFTs make them game changers:
- They allow for true ownership of digital-only goods in a transparent and indisputable way, thanks to the data being recorded on a public blockchain.
- Their liquidity and tradeability have spawned a whole industry of games, marketplaces, auction houses, and virtual worlds.
- They create provable scarcity of digital items.
- They can be programmed.

That last part is incredibly powerful.  We now have tokens presenting rare digital items that can be controlled by smart contracts to, for example, react to the price of Ethereum by changing features of an artwork.   

So far, this wonderful innovation has mostly been used to maximise profit.  But just imagine the other possibilities that this could lead to as a more efficient way of embedding information, using the more efficient information network of blockchain.

### To recap:

- Each NFT token is unique and not interchangable.
- This allows for true ownership of unique digital assets, like art.
- NFTs follow several standards on the Ethereum blockchain, such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155.
- As well as art and collectibles, NFTs have been used for ticketing, awards & gifts, "proof of attendance" (POAP) badges and much, much more.
- Many other use cases for NFTs are being developed all the time. Basically, anywhere possession of a unqiue token can allow the owner certain rights or privileges.

When it comes to NFTs, you are only limited by your imagination!
