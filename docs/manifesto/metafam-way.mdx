### Undertaking massive social coordination while having fun with it

We are the new generation shaping tomorrow's world, we are a community that predict our future by building it together, not by speculating about it, by delivering stuff, by doing. Yes! We have a bias towards action.

Unicorns of the future won't be from the Silicon Valley, they will be from peer-to-peer collaborative  movements bonded by purpose and their maximized productivity where freelacers take a marvel role. We understand that decentralized coordination is in its infancy so we are grewing it up by gamifying our labours and productivity tasks.

We commit to offer freelancers the possibility to join teams and projects with the easiness of signing up for an instagram account. We are building a place where you could get things done, working together with your palls, wehere you get paid for you contributions without any sneaky tracking mechanisms or ads being served to you.

Our strive is to embed collaboration into individuals and collective DNA, as we recognize it as the only way to maximize value. We work together to get things done, we share our POV's with abandon, openess, and consideration of other no matter how diverse their opinions might be. If we ever might compete among us, it shall be for eficiency and/or fun, not for gathering value at the cost of taking it from someone else.

We understand honest communication and integrity as part of the level of consciousness that we need to achieve to reach our goals, we are good listeners, we don't judge our palls but we work together for improving our own reputation we know how to take brutal feedback always that it is a constructive feedback. We take care of saying what we mean and meaning what we say.

Our commitment to open-source is unwavering, it goes beyond code to an open source mentallity. We are not afraid to share our ideas with other, even those outside our "circle" we are here to help and to move the world forward, which requires a constant awareness of the abundance of opportunties and resources we have before us.

We are the ones who understand the true power of the technologies that we use. Just as well we understand the responsibility. We will be careful and humble. We are not here for a revolution, but for a <!--consistent evolution instead of --> persistent gradual change. We will strain our horses if needed and steer our chariot of disruption gracefully.

### MetaGamer's are motivated by the outcome of the Game ~~not~~ *then the* personal gain.
