## A real-life MMO-RPG

> *If life is a game, MetaGame is about redefining the way we play it.*

MetaGame is an experiment seeking more efficient & fun ways of progressing through life and organizing societies in which self-interest is better aligned with the common-interest. 

Aiming to reorganize the world by leveraging cutting-edge technologies like the blockchain, MetaGame is here to empower people & communities through a gamified framework for facilitating development, incentivizing collaboration & coordinating at scale. Quite literally building a new world a layer atop of the old one.

## Back in Reality

MetaGame is being built by a bunch of weird dreamers who decided to take matters into their own hands. It is not a utopia & though the chances of us fully realizing the vision of MetaGame are extremely slim, but there's *nothing* we'd rather be doing. You will inevitably encounter things that are broken or suck ass & it's up to you to suggest improvements.
