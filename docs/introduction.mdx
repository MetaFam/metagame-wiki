Essentially, MetaGame is a real-life MMO-RPG. More importantly, it is an experiment in finding better ways of organizing societies at scale; societies in which self-interest is better aligned with the common-interest.

Since digging further will tell you all about what MetaGame is (or wants to be), let us start with what it isn‚Äôt:
-   MetaGame is not a solution to all the world‚Äôs problems, though some of us may seem convinced that it is.

Furthermore, a lot of the things you‚Äôll encounter will be of laughably low quality or outright stupid. 
What you need to keep in mind is that everything in MetaGame is minimum viable; when you see things of low quality, you should take it as a challenge for you to help improve them.

And the same way everything here is minimum viable, so should your expectations be.

:::note
Every element of MetaGame is a debatable and an ever-evolving community effort.
