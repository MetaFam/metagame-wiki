## Out of nowhere?

Well, not really. I have been waiting for someone to do it, ever since my brain was first occupied by this ‚Äú_Ethereum world computer_‚Äù meme;

> ‚ÄúHoly shit! This is the software infrastructure layer we need for a fair socioeconomic system of the future!‚Äù

It is only now that I said: _I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt at least try._
## Why now?

Back in May, Peter published a call-to-action article titled ‚Äú[Rising threats to Ethereum‚Äôs first-mover advantage](https://medium.com/metacartel/rising-threats-to-ethereums-first-mover-advantage-6138bd6c860)‚Äù which introduced me to the colorful bunch you might know as the _MetaCartel_.

He receives my message, and a week later, he‚Äôs onboarding me to the _MetaCartel_ ‚Äî over a burrito and some ale, after the ‚ÄúYear of The DAO‚Äù meetup in Ljubljana, where I set out to meet him.

Coming into _MetaCartel_ looking for problems ‚Äî I noted a few things missing that would be useful for a rapidly expanding network:

-   Some sort of a guide ‚Äî introducing people to what we‚Äôre about, and how to find your place among us,
-   Repositories of ideas, solutions, members ‚Äî and their needs and offers,
-   A map of the whole thing.


## MetaCartel Blackpaper v0.1

You may, if so curious, go and scroll through this [original paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZw3l3wDxrZuyVW0j-ipbFDyy-_xUtmMqSd4wo2STjQ/edit) including the illustration above ‚Äî but it has been long abandoned.

I must have been writing it for no longer than 3 days, when Peter contacted me again, saying:

> _‚ÄúHey, I like what you‚Äôre doing, here‚Äôs 1k DAI of the funds Binance gave me!‚Äù_

It‚Äôs not a lot of money, but it‚Äôs a lot of affirmation ‚Äî getting money without asking for it? Usually not even in crypto.

## Onwards

As my work on the paper progressed, more crucial elements were added:

-   Titles ‚Äî knowing who‚Äôs accountable for what keeps things moving and makes it easier to navigate the cartel.
-   Achievements ‚Äî knowing who did what, also pretty useful.


And with the idea growing from a simple way of making the _MetaCartel_ easier to understand and oversee, into‚Ä¶ this; I needed to go out and meet more fellow _carteleans_, get some feedback and some apostles.

So I got my ticket, helped put together the ‚Äú_MetaCartel Mansion_‚Äù and boarded the plane to Berlin.

Besides the _MetaCartel Demo Day_, my pilgrimage went around _DappCon_, _Token Engineering_, _Governance Games_, _ETHBerlin_, and whatever smaller event wasn‚Äôt too far off the trail ‚Äî the folk seemed receptive to my meme, to say the least...

Not having known I needed to register, devious tactics had to be deployed.

-   My debt towards the folk of _ETHBerlin_ was wiped by my helping the Odyssy _([DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/))_ team, not just shillin‚Äô muh own shie‚Äô.


During the final hours of the hackathon, while waiting for the team presenting to the judges ‚Äî my hand started sketching up the UX flowchart... This is what came out:

> The left represents some of the components, the middle 1/3 represents the player journey, and the right side is the value proposition.

Thinking through this complex system where not just people, but an institution, may join ‚Äî it became obvious there was a problem‚Ä¶

-   If the _Moloch DAO_, _Ethereum Foundation_, or _ConsenSys_ wanted to join, they would probably not want to be under the _MetaCartel_.
-   Let alone some people from outside crypto‚Ä¶


It became apparent that _The Game_ has to be a layer above. _The Game,_ was no longer to be called _MetaCartel;_

-   The game is to be called _**MetaGame.**_
-   The concept behind it coined; ‚Äú_**A Massive Online Coordination Game‚Äù**_

## Genesis

The first _MetaGame_ presentation was held by a lake with a wooden stick pointing at _the paper_ laying on the ground ‚Äî and that‚Äôs about all you need to know about that faithful day‚Ä¶

I traveled back home, almost missing my flight;

-   The following day, awakening from my 16-hour slumber, MetaGame was *ON*


And that‚Äôs how MetaGame was born;
