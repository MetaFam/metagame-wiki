_The 300 of MetaGame_ are a small army bringing MetaGame to life. 

*The 300* are made up of Players & Patrons; 150 of those building MetaGame and 150 of those providing liquidity.

There are plenty of reasons one might want to become one of the founders of MetaGame; from leveling up personally & the promise of building a better world, to the status of being one of its founders & the potential of a monetary payoff.

## **14 Reason** _**The 300**_ **Love MetaGame ü•∞**

A bunch of nobodies from around the internet. Some anons & some simply unknowns. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

-   None of us went to Harvard or Yale.
-   None of us have "prev. @FAANG" in our bios.
-   What we do have is an understanding of the potential of crypto.
-  And a burning desire to build a better future.

Though we're the ones building this specific metagame called MetaGame; we're far from the only ones playing the metagame.

- A metagamer is anyone who says "fuck off" to the old game of working for corporations & fighting their battle for ever more profit and instead focuses on creating the new game of life with purpose driven organizations.
- Anyone who chose to escape the drudgery of a 9-5 job & enter the future of work by joining a DAO or starting their own.

- Is it *you*?

Anyway, here's the current list of all [players](https://my.metagame.wtf/players) & [patrons](https://my.metagame.wtf/patrons).
