title: ðŸ¤¨ What are we doing?
---


Currently, there are two main goals of MetaGame:
-   Build a gamified onboarding machine for DAO contributors
-   Establish a "decentralized factory" to support people building DAOs

With the end goal of:

-   Creating a new kind of society, one that is optimized for human & ecosystem well-being rather than profit.

  

Things we're doing or did to get there:

### Producing content
    
We are producing educational & other content such as Playbooks, Great Houses & MetaRadio as well as publishing recordings of the events we are organizing, such as community calls with guest speakers & conferences or MetaFest.
    
### Organizing events
    
Regularly bringing awesome people to present at our community calls or do workshops. Also organized a conference, a hackathon & a festival.
    
### Assembling the puzzle
    
Building things like MetaSys & MyMeta as well as the MetaOS - to make it easy to integrate other people's building blocks & deploy your own coordination games.
    
### Uniting aligned peoples
    
Bringing together anyone aligned on the idea of building a new kind of society; individuals joining MetaFam as well as projects joining the MetaAlliance.

###   Helping people find their metagame
To find your metagame means to play life optimally - coordinating with others on building a better world; doing things that create a positive impact, make you happy AND earn you money.
    

In short, anything & everything related to DAOs & helping people build the future they want to live in.
