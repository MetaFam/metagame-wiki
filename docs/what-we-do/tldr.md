title: ðŸ¤¨ WTF we do tl;dr
---


Currently, there are two main goals of MetaGame:
-   Build a gamified onboarding machine for DAO contributors
-   Establish a "decentralized factory" to support people building DAOs

With the end goal of:

-   Creating a new kind of society, one that is optimized for human & ecosystem well-being rather than profit.

  

Things we're doing or did to get there:

###   Curate content
-   Giving a meta overview & making it easier to explore different fields of interest such as: [Ethereum, DAOs, NFTs, DeFi & dApps](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/great-houses/house-of-ethereum)
-   Introducing people to cool projects
### Organize events
-   Every Friday we have 2+ guests join our community call & talk about their project, mostly DAOs
-   Workshops almost every week
-   Organized the first virtual conference in the Ethereum space at the onset of covid - [InterCon](https://medium.com/@pethereum/sure-the-future-is-remote-and-virtual-conferences-will-be-a-thing-but-we-arent-doing-this-just-bd0eaef8132d)
-   Organized the first DAO focused hackathon - [Fork The World](https://metagame.substack.com/p/fork-the-world-hackathon)
-   Organized a month long virtual festival/conference/hackathon - [MetaFest](https://metafest.metagame.wtf/)
###  Produce content
-   Recordings of our events as well as explainer videos - [MetaMedia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gdZ6Q7Fwfvn-Uu4QKDyhg)
-   Multiple podcast series - [MetaRadio](https://anchor.fm/metagame/)
-   Guides on being useful in the space - [Playbooks](https://metagame.substack.com/p/wtf-are-the-great-houses-and-playbooks)
###   Build technologies
-   Put together the most capital efficient & _politically_ decentralized way of building DAOs - [MetaSys](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/Guilding/metasys)
-   Built decentralized profiles/workfolio pages - [MyMeta](https://metagame.substack.com/p/meta-31-wtf-is-mymeta-)
-   Building an open source operating system for decentralized societies - [MetaOS](https://metagame.substack.com/p/wtf-is-metaos)
### Weave networks & assemble building blocks
-   Bringing together aligned people & DAOs on a mission to assemble Web3 building blocks into a fully fledged decentralized society.
###   Help people find their metagame
-   To find your metagame means to play life in the most optimal way - coordinating with others on building a better world; doing things that create a positive impact, make you happy AND earn you money.

In short, anything & everything related to DAOs & helping people build the future they want to live in.
