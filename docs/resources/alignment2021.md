### Croatia, September 2021

None of us go to conferences to listen to people on stages saying mostly shit we already know.

The most enjoyable parts of the conference are usually the awesome two-or-more-way conversations, the people, and the smaller events such as dinners and after-parties.

So what if we stopped doing conferences and start doing alignment events. There would still be some talks, there would be some workshops & some hacking, it would just be way less formal, more participative, and a lot more fun.

## Accommodation:

[**The compound**](https://www.myistria.com/en/villas/in-pula/villa-istria-nuova#lg=1&slide=96) is made up of 3 villas, called **Sun**, **Water** and **Earth**:

The compound is a part of a small village, with offers for accommodating probably 50-100 other people.
