## Staying up to date

A number of tools and application support synchronization with Google Calendar.
For example, any calendar application on your iOS or Android phone.

Furthermore it is possible for anyone interested to customize the way you are notified about event changes, updates, and new events.

Instructions to configure various applications and operating systems are out of scope.
But we are happy to help if you can't figure it out, just ask us on Discord!
