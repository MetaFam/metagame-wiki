## Overview: üêô 

The vision for MetaGame is to be the ‚Äúvirtual Silicon Valley‚Äù connecting all the fragmented pieces of web3 and the people building them together, measuring and gamifying value creation (powered by SourceCred). This will be the main funnel for onboarding people into Web3 / MetaVerse. Leaderboards, achievements, quests, and everything else we need to make it fun, engaging and rewarding. Native integrations with other MetaCartel projects like MetaFactory, MetaCoin, DAOHaus/PokeMol etc. The whole thing being ‚Äúnoob friendly‚Äù and easy to use as any modern app/game.

Defined "A Massive Online Coordination Game", or more simply "a sweet spot between a social network, a freelancing platform & a role playing game", MetaGame is more than it's definition. MetaGame is the idea we can build a new world atop of the old one, a more collaborative, transparent & fun world, a world in which self interest of all players is better aligned with the common good. A world unrestricted by physical boundaries.

*Note: every element of MetaGame, including this doc, is a debatable and an ever-evolving community effort. [Get involved](https://discord.com/invite/UnHwnzY)! If you have more questions, [check out the Metagame wiki](https://github.com/MetaFam/metagame-wiki)!*

### Core Principles & Values
- Open Source and Modular are the two most important things for everything MetaGame will do. UNIX philosophy, build everything in a reusable and composable way.
- We don‚Äôt build tools and then try to find use cases. We build use cases and then try to find the tools to fit them. Only if the current tools don‚Äôt fit will we will create new ones.
- See [MetaGame manifesto](https://github.com/MetaFam/Manifesto/blob/master/RoughV1) for details.

## The Road to Beta: Memebryo

<img alt="Memebryo" src={useBaseUrl('img/memebryo.png')} />

The goal of 1.0 is to build a home for all your web3 understanding and project building needs.
Some of the things it should contain include: Dapp building resources, idea validating groups, people willing to jump in and help build it or sell it and connections or at least links to potential investors. A place where freelancers may come, offer their services to growing
projects & earn equity. Described in more detail in the blog post dedicated to the narrative, [A Decentralized Factory](https://medium.com/@pethereum/narrative-1-a-decentralized-factory-9589e2246bb8).

A core component of this framework will be a platform that allows anyone anywhere (where DAOs are "anyone" as they are first class actors just like EOAs) to tokenize their value creation. They would be able to do so in a way that is social and gamified via SourceCred, personal tokens, and Guilds.

This would be built in a way that can be generalized into a platform that anyone can use for anything:

- Personal tokens
- Projects or Kickstarter type campaigns
- Guilds
- AngelList style investor information for DAOs that have tokens

A general purpose platform for anyone to raise funds via bonding curves. Since DAOs would be the backend of such a system, it would work for both individuals and organizations. It would be open source and created in a modular way so that anyone could deploy a platform like this for their use case (MetaGame being the first). Could be great for DAO investment platforms, social impact campaigns, decentralized kickstarter, etc...

This whole thing could really quickly become the socio-economic fabric of value creation in the web3 ecosystem if we execute it properly. It would immediately filter out the BS from the people actually creating value, and it opens up tons of future potential/integrations with the wider ecosystem. People will be able to make ‚Äúmicro-investments‚Äù in the future success of their peers, and it would create a platform for people to bootstrap themselves. Real skin in the game and proper economic incentives to drive value creation forward. All of it in a fun and gamified interface with huge potential for viral and organic growth.

### Part 1

A ‚Äúprofile page‚Äù where one could launch and sell their own bonding curve based personal tokens. This would include data visualizations to see who owns how much of who‚Äôs tokens and an ‚Äúexplore‚Äù page where people can discover, search, filter and see leaderboards of different personal tokens launched on the platform. 

From there we can iterate, adding the ability for people to post ‚Äúservices‚Äù in exchange for their personal tokens and allowing people to purchase those services straight from their profile.

This would be a good enough basis for a functioning economy of value creation via personal tokens. Then we can take it further in many directions (guilds and DAOs etc).

- **Players:** MetaGame character profile pages will have a ‚Äúpersonal token‚Äù section where you can buy/sell/redeem personal tokens for an individual. This will create an easy way for people to mint their personal tokens and use it as a basis for funding the work they are doing, Patreon style. Anyone can buy or sell the tokens on a bonding curve, allowing people to get exposure to the future success of that individual. This allows for "micro investments" in people instead of projects.
- **Consumers:** You can see a list of services that the person offers and purchase them directly from their profile (e.g. 30min consultation for $XX, a retweet for $XX). Individuals can offer services / perks to people that buy their tokens, fiverr style. Once they receive their own tokens back, they can choose to hold on to them to keep the price of their token higher, or burn them back to the bonding curve to "pay themselves" the underlying value. This basically allows for "skin in the game" accountability to get shit done as well as a way to build reputation.
- **Investors:** There would be a ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù page where you can discover other players and their tokens. MetaGame profiles would then give you contextual information on who the person is, what projects/DAOs they are involved in, their verified social accounts (via 3Box), their skillset, and the XP they have in MetaGame/RaidGuild etc (powered by SourceCred). You can see the current value of their token, the circulating supply, etc. You can see which other MetaGame players hold their personal tokens and how many. You can see all the other personal tokens that this player holds and how many.

Ex: I go to your MetaGame profile, I can see all your connected social accounts, I can see all the DAOs you are a part of, I can see how much XP/cred you have in MetaGame or RaidGuild (powered by SourceCred) + any other MetaCartel projects we integrate into MetaGame in the future. In that same place, I can buy your personal tokens and also spend them on services you list on your profile (fiverr style).

### Part 2

#### Character Creation Optimization
- Enneagram test.
- Linking twitter, DAO memberships, gitcoin, ENS, and others (list off
any ideas you guys have here)
- Portfolio / skills showcase.
- Allow characters to assemble together into a guild. Guild profiles can have links to website, discords, etc as well as a list of members. Can generate an aggregate "personality" of a guild with enneagram scores of members.
- Allow guilds to specify the skills/character classes they are looking
for as well as active raids
    - (how do we manage who gets to control the guilds profile?)
    - (how do we get people to actually populate this information and keep
    it up to date)

#### MetaGraph
- Use the data from previous phases and run PageRank on it to generate a social graph of reputation, cluster people based on skills, personalities, social network followers/following, etc.
- One-two punch of sybil resistance and reputation that we can use to allow for better
discovery and visibility of the wider ecosystem. Breaks down silos.
- Run SourceCred on the graph of who owns whose personal tokens and their values to generate a ‚Äúreputation score‚Äù for how distributed and valuable someones tokens are. E.g. If thousands of people own Vitaliks token and Vitalik owns my token, it increases the ‚Äúscore‚Äù of my token since its owned by a trusted member of the community. This helps prevent scammy behavior and incentivizes people to actually use and distribute their tokens well. It can be the basis of a sybil-resistant social reputation system or ‚Äúweb of trust‚Äù, allowing for a better and more nuanced indicator of identity while allowing people to remain pseudonymous.

#### Other Things
- On people‚Äôs MetaGame profiles we can show a special symbol that indicates this person was ‚Äúmoonlit‚Äù by MCV (equivalent to saying backed by YC, but for web3). The demand for that persons services / tokens would then go up and we are able to boost and signal under-rated people in the ecosystem and help them grow and thrive while getting exposure to their future success.
- Better discovery tools / social features for Explore page (e.g. ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the tokens that are held by people in your token portfolio‚Äù, ‚Äútop trending tokens of the week‚Äù) etc.
- People could stake their reputation/tokens to take out a undercollateralized DeFi loan ([Aragon Agent!](https://aragon.org/agent/))
- ‚ÄúGuild Tokens‚Äù that wrap buying proportional amounts of the personal tokens that are contained within. Creates a ‚Äúsoul bond‚Äù between teams by getting them to all give some of their personal tokens into this wrapper token, gamifying everyone to create as much value for each other as possible. (üêª [MetaShareBears!](https://www.notion.so/ShareBears-c3b137dd2b944cf889b1b198fd91909e))
- Haos of DAOs (what is this?)
- Haos of Defiance (what is this?)
- Haos of Houses (‚Äúbnb‚Äù, coworking, coliving)
- ChievMint Factory (this is being built right?)
- The Eyez - Supply & Demand (Everest?)
- The ‚Äúsocial‚Äù bubble from the above becomes a full blown social network dashboard.
- A ‚Äúsocial‚Äù bubble for Discords, Discourses and Telegram chats
- A ‚Äúnews‚Äù bubble for our Substacks and other publications
- An ‚ÄúAFK‚Äù bubble for meetups, conferences, alignment events
- An ‚ÄúEmpowerMe‚Äù bubble guides for building code, community etc.
- Fully integrated Challenges & Quests
- Better Leaderboard
