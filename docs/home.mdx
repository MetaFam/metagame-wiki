## Abstract

As you might understand by now, we are building an Onboarding Machine & a Decentralized Factory for the Ethereum DAO ecosystem - but also much more than that.

In fact, MetaGame is not about technology at all. Although obsessed with DAOs & building things such as the MetaOS, the goal of MetaGame is not to be devoted to any specific tech.

‚ÄúMetagame is any approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.‚Äù - From Wikipedia

The goal of MetaGame is to build a new kind of socioeconomic system. One less oriented around value extraction & profit, more focused on solving problems our societies are facing, making an impact & helping each other become better versions of ourselves.

We‚Äôre calling it a massive online coordination game, so what are we coordinating towards?

-   Finding the most optimal ways to play life, individually as well as collectively.
    
-   Building the future we want to live in.
    

This includes all of the above; working on things we find meaningful with cool people, solving coordination problems, building better systems & regenerating our ecosystems.
