# Abstract

As you might understand by now, we're building an Onboarding Machine & a Decentralized Factory for the Ethereum DAO ecosystem - but also much more.

In fact, MetaGame is not about technology at all. Although obsessed with DAOs & building things such as the MetaOS, the goal of MetaGame is not to be devoted to any specific technology.

> ‚ÄúMetagame is any approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.‚Äù - From Wikipedia

The goal of MetaGame is to build a new kind of socioeconomic system. One less oriented around value extraction & profit, more focused on solving problems our societies are facing, making an impact & helping each other become better versions of ourselves.

> "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete." - Buckminster Fuller

It's a *massive online coordination game*, so what are we coordinating towards?

-   Finding the most optimal ways to play life, individually as well as collectively.
-   Building the future we want to live in.

This means working on things we find meaningful along with cool people; solving coordination problems, building better systems & regenerating our ecosystems.
