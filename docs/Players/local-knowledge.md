# Local Knowledge (FAQ)

### 🔍 How do raids form?
1. Ideas on what to build next mostly pop-up inside the Discord first. They are bounced around until there’s enough interest.
2. Then it’s time to collect feedback & write up a thread about it on the forums before it gets lost in the noise.
3. Whoever likes the idea then makes it a topic of discussion on one of the calls, where we decide if it's feasible to pursue at the moment.
4. If yes, we figure out the next steps and get on with it.

__This is highly informal, and most work can be done informally without any approval process.__


### 🔍 Where can I find details on current raids?
- The [board](https://forum.metagame.wtf/c/quest/5/l/latest?board=default) of ongoing raids.
- [Thread](https://forum.metagame.wtf/c/sourcing/2) of raid suggestions (where you can propose your own).
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/VYZPBnx) is also a great way to tap into what the community is talking about.
