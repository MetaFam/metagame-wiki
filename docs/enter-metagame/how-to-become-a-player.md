# How to Become a Player of MetaGame

So you've been tumbling down this rabbit hole & are wondering how to actually start playing MetaGame? ü§î

Well alright! Let's get you geared up! ü§†

First thing to know here is that MetaGame is a *choose-your-own-adventure* game.
The quests below are the **easiest way for you to join, contribute & earn some [XP](/docs/how-does-it-work/xp)** - but completing them is not mandatory. You are free to go and start playing any of the open roles listed in the next article, or start contributing directly to one of [ongoing raids](navigation-board.md) displayed on the battlefield.

This is a bonus quest. As mentioned at the beginning of this wiki, ***all of this*** is just a work in progress. If you consider yourself more of a scholar than a doer, help us see the blind spots and expand on the MetaGame lines of thinking.
### ‚ùì To accomplish:
- Read all of [wiki](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/).
- Report inconsistent or out of date content, or suggest new content on the [forums](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/i-think-we-should/141) or in [the tavern](https://discord.gg/axebUqq).
- Or just start further clarifying & extending the content yourself.
### ‚úÖ To complete:
- This is where the magic starts. Regardless of whether you posted your improvement or suggestion on the forums or on github - if other players find your contribution valuable, you will automatically be rewarded XP.


## Now what?
Now you try wearing some hats and see which ones fit you best :)
