## 📜Block #10

**🗺️ General**
- Seeds pump even harder, almost quadrupling since the last newsletter.
- MyMeta makes good progress towards full realization.
- The effect of The Purge continues: the number of active players increases, while the total number of players actually decreases. 😱


**🗺️ State of Raids**

- ***🎎 MyMeta***
This is still the most important raid. We’ve recently received a small grant from the MetaCartel & have been pushing out updates. The latest version is live here.

Discounting the fact that some of these things are still hardcoded, the live version is almost as good as the design demo we previewed 2 weeks ago.

We had a live raid yesterday; introducing new members to the codebase and the old ones to the latest changes, brainstorming & co-hacking.


So yeah, the raid has been progressing pretty good & the team has been growing. The basics are pretty much done and the design & the Discord bot we’ll use for the guild pages are both coming along nicely.

- ***🧠 MetaLibrary***
It's almost time to rebrand the wiki to the MetaLibrary - but not quite yet. To really make it into a MetaLibrary, we’ll need at least those “House of Ethereum”, “House of dApps”, “House of Tokens” & “House of Defiance” posts.

Why aren’t those new posts there already?
Well, because I have been revamping all the existing posts, writing the missing intro/onboarding pieces, and actually, spending ever more time inside DMs & chat channels responding to people - which is kind of becoming my frustration, as already stated above. 😅

- ***🌱 Seed Market 💸***
I think it's safe to say MetaGame’s liquidity problem has successfully been dealt with.

Seed price: ~$43
Seed marketcap: ~$600k
In the liquidity pool: ~$74k
Treasury funds used? ~$2/30k

Frankly, the Seed market has been blowing up for the past few days. Though -50% from the all-time high of over $80, the Seed price seems to have somewhat stabilized at ~$40, which is still more than 4x just a week ago.

If you’ve been useful around MetaGame, you likely have a decent sum now 🙃

- ***📻 MetaRadio***
The new podcast episode is out!

Autonomous Genesis - Real World DAOs & Regenerative Economies

You might notice it's called “Autonomous Genesis” and not “MetaView”. No, we haven’t rebranded the podcast - we launched a new podcast; two new podcasts to be more precise! 😱

You’re going to be funding 3 podcasts now? 👀

Not exactly, the idea with the Autonomous Podcast is that it will run & pay itself. Each new guest will interview the next guest as well as pay for the production cost of the next episode.


The Autonomous Genesis will now branch into two podcast chains:

Autonomous A - fixing the world with technology.

Autonomous B - fixing the world with non-profits.

- ***👕 MetaMerch***
The store itself still isn’t up but we do have some fresh designs!

Maybe start warming up for these drops?


& last but not least…

- ***💨 Website Migration!***
We spent a lot of time building the profiles & upgrading the wiki. It's about time to start the integration process of moving everything into metagame.wtf.

Here’s the latest design of the navigation bar/app drawer, closed & open 👇


But what goes into all that background? 😱

You’ll know soon enough 🙃

Not just refusing to leak our alpha, we’re also not yet sure ourselves. We only know it will be some kind of a dashboard & likely a feed.
We’ll be doing a design sprint with the folks over from Deep Work to work out which of the 100 awesome ideas we should build first.




## 📜Block #9


- We got invited to join the Panvala matching league! Thanks, Niran! 🥰
- We received a couple grand from Commons Stack’sPanvala matching pool prize. Griff himself joins the Patrons of MetaGame. Welcome, fam! ✌️
- Following up on last week’s interview with Kevin, we started brainstorming on possible ways to collaborate. Something interesting might be brewing between Gitcoin & MetaGame 🙃
- Exciting news about the podcast itself coming in the next few days as well. The upcoming episode with Magenta of Bloom Network should air tomorrow, but the episode itself is kind of a beginning 👀
- Jason Yin translates the wiki to Mandarin and kicks-off MetaGame China then brings in a bunch of students & teachers with whom he is building a college for entrepreneurs in Beijing - hoping to integrate learnings from MetaGame 😱
- The MyMeta funding proposal to the MetaCartel was a success! 💸 We’ll soon start using those funds to buy back Seeds from the builders and adding them to the liquidity pool! Good progress made on profiles themself.
- Some of the notables reactivating or joining are Luke of 1Hive as a Patron, Vanmoortel as both a Patron & an Inner Circle player & Alec the latest high-skill builders but also a bunch of old hodlors checking-in & adding liquidity.
- MetaGame got listed on Coingecko & Seeds had their first pump. 🤩 Currently sitting at $22, up from $18 yesterday, up from $9 on Wednesday, up from $6 since the pool launch - not bad.
- Frens: dump the pump.


Finally, as you might already be aware, Dunbar’s limit on Players was hit a while ago and we’ve been regularly cleaning the membership…
So far we’ve only kicked out ~20/150 people, but we’re currently 10 members over the cap due to the MetaGame China players & the waitlist has gotten significantly longer yesterday. Expect the purges to accelerate. 😬


## 📜Block #8
- The new podcast episode is live! MetaView #9 - Owocki of Gitcoin on Public Goods Funding, Onboarding & Rewarding Systems.
- The Wiki continues receiving a stream of updates. After a full remake of the intro, roadmap & how to play - the main navigation page receives a major facelift. 👇
- mZ writes up a bunch of proposals up on the forums. Proposal #0: Minimum Viable Proposal Procedure, Proposal #1: Cap Issuance Rate of New Seeds & Proposal #2: Treasury Seed Buy Back Policy - go share your thoughts.
- Based on popular demand for clarity about the XP & Seed system, the post has been rewritten from ~750 words down to ~450, now with much more clarity. 👇
- The new Seed Market has been live running for ~5 days now with up to $22.4k liquidity - not bad for an ~$80k marketcap token!
- The minting of the next batch of Seeds is underway!
- A few more people lose their player status 😬.
Note:
- Don’t forget to plant & water your Seeds. 🙏



## 📜Block #7
- An all-new onboarding system. As mentioned already, we’re no longer just letting everybody in. No more intro quests either - sign up through here instead.
- More people proceed not to sell us any Seeds? Damn it y’all.
- Continued upgrading Discord: Reordered & deleted channels. Updated descriptions & added emojis. Added a new channel: #🚨issues-n-ideas.
- A few people came to present their projects to the community & they were pretty cool - you should have been there 😜
- We continued tying up the wiki into something more coherent & prettier to look at. A new landing page merging “intro” & all 3 types coming. Copy below.
- Submitted a $5k proposal to the MetaCartel 🤞
- The Stoa kindly hosted my MG talk and it was awesome. Never met such an engaged audience - spoke for 10 minutes then answered questions for another 45.
- Luxumbra moves up to Golden Fam 😱
- A few more people lose their memberships, and Tweetious becomes the first one to receive the Protected Player role - obtained by hodling 20+ Seeds.
- Finalized all we needed to know about the new balancer smart pool thanks to mZ. Launch imminent; next Seed minting t-3 days.
- As requested through the last newsletter’s poll, the long term vision of MetaGame has been laid out in the new Phases of MetaGame. 👇

## 📜Block #6
- The MyMeta flow is now connected to the back-end, which means you can finally permanently upgrade your profile with goodies such as personality type & skills.
- We had a call oriented around upgrading the wiki last week. It resulted in a lot of discussions and only going through ~10% of the wiki, so we decided to do it async.
- We’re in talks with the Balancer team, setting up a smart pool to allow us to later change the pool parameters through the DAO vs the current set-forever pool.
- We got the Zerion team to list Seeds on Zerion!
- Kay built a new embassy, this time bridging MetaGame comms to Sourcecred.
- I did a lot of thinking & writing on the framing of MetaGame and the onboarding system. From a new intro, through this how-to-play, to the onboarding guide, etc.
- Recorded a new MetaRadio episode, this one with Stani of Aave - then realized the recording cuts off after the first 2 minutes. 🤦‍♂️ Kevin of Gitcoin next up!
- We launched Achievmintry, an achievement minting DAO, in collaboration with the Raid Guild & MetaCartel. Moar soon.
- 10 players lose their player status as 10 new people join. Yes, the curation is real.
Kind of a slow week tbh.


## 📜Block #5
- Hammad switches us to Vercel allowing for more dynamic change-making, implements imgix to make the site load faster & deploys the whole thing to a permanent domain - MyMeta is now live! 😱
- We had another call with 3Box, Raid Guild & 1Hive to get updated on the latest from 3Box and hopefully follow up by joining forces on building MyMeta.
- We also got two more developers to join the MyMeta team; ECWireless & Damjan.
- But we need moar. MOAR DEVELOPERS.
- Luxumbra does a complete redesign of the wiki, with some help from Saimano in removing useless things & me in throwing a bunch of ideas up the wall. Made it look as slick as MyMeta; screenshots below.
- Vanilla graduates our announcements channel into an actual announcements channel, allowing others to subscribe to it. Also makes the meta-announcements channel aka #📣-metaphone live, after adding DAOHaus & MetaMedia to a full list of guilds it is subscribed to - Raid Guild, 1Hive, LexDAO & MetaFactory.
- Topping it off, he also added a bunch of new roles and the #role-select channel to help us target the right players for announcements and calls to action.
- Go pick yourself a role! 🙃
- I added a channel too, #my-thing - for you to shill your startup, project, or whatever hobby or skill you’re working on! 🤗
- New podcast episode is live! This time we talked to Griff Green of Commons Stack on topics ranging from community-building, values in the Ethereum space, and the broader crypto space drama.
- Then on the 27th of October, I’ll be getting interviewed myself - forThe Stoa. 😮

## 📜Block #4
Last week we sent out a newsletter asking y’all to sell your Seeds to us so that we can use them to provide liquidity. Surprisingly, nobody wants to sell their Seeds. Out of 12,295 Seeds minted for 55 people, only 2 people were willing to sell some. A grand total of 275 Seeds - 186 of which were picked up by an unknown address. 😅
This makes us both happy & sad. Happy, because it shows that most of you still have faith in MetaGame. Sad, because it means we might have to mint Seeds for liquidity after all. Should we? (only players can access the linked channel)
Onwards:
- Dan13 added skills to MyMeta profiles & made good progress on the profile creation flow.
- Vanilla added a meta-announcements channel and connected it to 4 other discords: Raid Guild, 1Hive, LexDAO & MetaFactory.
- Also added the “!?token” & “!?quests” to the list of bot commands bringing up useful info.
- Peth wrote a page about DAOs, explaining what they are with all the links & resources.
- Also fixed the images on the front page of the wiki, formatting on a bunch of articles & added the DAO canvas page.
- Saimano did some work on updating the design of the wiki, Luxumbra taking the reins & hopefully submitting a PR tonight.
- Kay built the first embassy, creating a direct communications channel between MetaGame & 1Hive.
- YoungKidWarrior built a BrightID verification bot for Discord.
- Ben.oxmo built a bot for Sourcecred to relay cred scores & stats to Discord channels and players, allowing us to significantly shorten the feedback loop

## 📜Block #3
Yep yee! It’s that time again!
- We minted a bunch of Seeds for anyone who ever contributed to MetaGame! 😮
- You might have gotten some without even knowing - check yoself.
- You might have deserved some but didn’t get any - let us know.
- If you used the #set-eth-address on our Discord, you probably have some Seeds now.

## 📜Block #2

- On Friday calls we set up the agenda for the week.
- Seeing people tend to… Not really do what they say they’ll do; I started regularly checking up on people and asking about their progress.
Yesterday was that day. Today, I woke up to a response from one of the core contributors asking to be removed from the inner circle. 😦
- I like being angry more than I like being sad - the angry energy is easier to put to good use while sadness usually just makes me unproductive.


## 📜Block #1
Wut Happened?
We spent the last call going through how the Navigation Board works, what raids are there & assigning players to lead them.
- At the beginning of the call, I (peth) was the only one on the map.
- By the end of the call, there were only 4/14 spots left in the inner circle. 😶



## 📜Genesis Block

Happy Birthday MetaGame! 🎂🎉🎊🎈
- Damn, has it been that long already?
Yessir!
- And what have you done?
A major part of the first year was spent defining what exactly MetaGame is, what its goals are, what it requires on the technical side of things, and how it would actually work. It took a lot of talking & a lot of writing it out.
We’re far from figuring everything out, but we’ve come far enough to have built up the knowledge base, set up the basic rewards & economic system, built the first version of MyMeta, and prototyped MetaMaps & MetaVille.
Other than figuring things out & setting the foundations, I’d say most of the time was spent finding the right people and building the community. Could have gone the more traditional way of raising money & offering paychecks, but by doing it this way we stayed true to our philosophy & attracted the missionaries - not mercenaries.

Alright, let’s get into some achievements:
- First presented on a crypto meetup (October 2019)
- First raid party - seeding MetaGame cards (Devcon, October 2019)
- First bots deployed (November 2019)
- XP System implemented (SourceCred, December 2019)
- First achievement NFTs minted (Mintbase, January 2020)
- First website launched (February 2020)
- First version of Interspace deployed (February 2020)
- First presentation at a conference (ETHCC, March 2020)
- First to do a virtual conference in the Ethereum space (InterCon, March 2020)
- Seed Market launched (April 2020)
- First life affected (May 2020)
- Organized the first DAO hackathon (Fork The World, July 2020)
- Reached Closed Beta (August 2020)
- First version of MyMeta built (August 2020)
- First version of MetaMaps built (August 2020)
- Aaand some numbers up until now:

Number #3 most funded in Gitcoin's CLR round 4
- 6 podcast episodes published
- 15 articles written
- 51 newsletters delivered
- 62 meetups held
- 137 registered contributors
- 217 contributors to our gitcoin grant
- 376 people receiving our newsletters
- 751 people on our discord
- 1062 people following us on Twitter
- $20k+ raised in grants
- $50k+ worth of Seeds minted
- Over 9000 funs had

I know you’re used to seeing bigger numbers from all of these shiny new defi platforms, but it’s a bit harder to attract the people & capital when you’re not offering the prospects of getting rich quick 😅
Consider also that MetaGame was started by a one-man team, an ex-plumber-dude with no entrepreneurial experience - and it all makes more sense, doesn’t it? This dumbass had to spend the majority of his time convincing others that building MetaGame is worth their time.
To be fair, talented & competent did join MetaGame, but the problem is that all of them have been working on it as a side thing. Unable to pay their bills, MetaGame can’t compete with their main focus of attention.
