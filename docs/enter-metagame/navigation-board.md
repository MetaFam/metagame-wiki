title: 🗺️ State of Raids
---

This is a map of all the current raids going on inside MetaGame.
As such, they represent a chance for you to earn reputation, money & stake in MetaGame.

Based on [Doughnut Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_%28economic_model%29), here's how to read the map:
-  **Gray circle** - raids outside of it are not actively being worked on yet.
-  **Green circle** - raids on the green line are progressing at an optimal rate.
-  **Red circle** - getting close to it means a raid is under-resourced or stalling.
-  **A yellow node** - just something we’re working on.
-  **A orange node** - a high priority initiative.
-  **In the middle** - players casting spells on nearby raids.
-  **Above them** - MetaGame Realization Crystal & its mana bar.
