title: ðŸ‘½ Join MetaGame
---
You didn't think we just let anyone in, did you?
There are two ways to prove your worth & join MetaGame ðŸ™ƒ

## Join as a Player
We are currently above the Dunbar's limit but you can fill out the form below & enter the judgement queue.
If the *Onboarders of MetaGame* deem your application worthwhile, you will be contacted & given an *Engaged Octo* role as a trial to prove your worth.
The form isn't loading? Go [through here](https://form.typeform.com/to/RZLnpeBa).

import { TypeformWidget } from '../../src/components/typeform';

<TypeformWidget campaign='RZLnpeBa' />

## Join as a Patron
Eager to support the cause & impatient to join?
You can skip the queue by joining as a Patron instead!
- Water our seeds by depositing WETH [here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xea05a15dbce2eb543ffda16950e95b2bd2e40d0e/)(Make sure you deposit enough WETH to generate 8 pSEEDs.)
- Enter [here](https://discord.gg/d3rurFAK6M) & type in "!join"

Want a more in-depth guide to doing this? Check the [Patrons Path](https://www.notion.so/Patron-Path-1db90c8bb4c84398a6fe1f672ea5e855).

## Join as a Guild
We are currently not accepting new guilds into MetaGame & the list of candidates to join next is long. Want your project to be considered a candidate for the next batch of *Guilds of MetaGame*? Join as a player or a patron now, shill your project & make some friends.

## Join Discord
Either way, you can join the limited [few channels on Discord](https://discord.gg/cDcY8FpGAB) & ask around. Maybe the *Onboarders* like you enough to make you a Player ðŸ™ƒ
