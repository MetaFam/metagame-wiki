Since we don't have the guild pages for MyMeta set up yet, we'll just do it this way. Here's the list of all the guilds that share 1 or more members with MetaGame and are in one way or another affiliated.

<details>
<summary>🤔 Wait, WTF are guilds?</summary>
Guilds are just groups of people doing cool things.
They can be centered around producing the building blocks for a decentralized future, or they can be centered around providing services to others who *are* building these blocks. They can also be both.
They may or may not be DAOs - although most *will* be.
